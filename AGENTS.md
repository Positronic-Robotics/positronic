# Contributor guide

## Local environment
- Use `uv` tool to manage python environment

## Testing insturctions
- Find the CI plan in .github/workflows directory.
- The work is done in virtual environment (`.venv/bin/activate`). You may need to initialise it when running scripts.
- Run tests locally using `pytest` command. Disable coverage with `--no-cov` argument.
- Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.
- Don't add new test files unless explicitly asked
