# Code Rules

Judgment rules for this repository — the checks a linter cannot make.

Every rule has an **id** — its heading. Cite it when reporting, fixing, or waiving a violation. Add,
calibrate, and retire rules through the `add-rule` skill.

## Waiving a rule

A violation is waived when the offending line or its enclosing block carries:

```python
# rules-allow: <rule-id> — <reason>
```

The reason must say why this instance is correct. One rule id, at the site — as narrow as a `noqa`.

## Rules

### caller-in-name

Don't name anything — function, class, module, variable — after where it is used. Name it after what it
does. Information about the callers must not leak into the name.

A helper that recomposes a pose through a fixed transform is `change_frame`, not `to_policy_frame`: it
has never heard of a policy.

### hardcoded-keys

Don't write the names of shared data as bare literals — dict keys, signal names, field paths. The name
is a contract between whoever writes the data and whoever reads it, and a literal leaves that contract
invisible and repeated.

Two remedies, by who owns the name. When callers may legitimately use different names, take it as a
parameter with a default for the usual one. When everyone must agree on the same name, define it once
as a named constant in a shared module.

Exception: a name the component itself owns and defines, rather than one it reads from its input.

```python
# Bad
return {**data, 'ee_pose': change_frame(data['ee_pose'])}

# Good — pose_key is a constructor parameter defaulting to 'ee_pose'
return {**data, self._pose_key: change_frame(data[self._pose_key])}
```

### overspecific

Don't bake assumptions about how a component will be used into its interface. Before adding a
parameter, a branch, or a category to a signature, ask what else the component could legitimately be
asked to do — many keys instead of one, several value types instead of one, the same operation in
reverse. Where handling those uniformly makes the code **shorter**, the specific version is wrong.

Generalise until it simplifies, and stop there. A parameter, flag, or strategy object added for a case
nobody has is the same mistake pointed the other way.

```python
# Bad — assumes every key belongs to exactly one category, and that the categories need different handling
def __init__(self, pose_keys, command_keys): ...

# Good — one list, handled the same way in both directions
def __init__(self, keys): ...
```
